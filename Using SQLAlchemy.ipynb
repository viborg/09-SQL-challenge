    "# Using SQLAlchemy for Python interaction with a database\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook introduces using SQLAlchemy to interact with a PostgreSQL database.  It readily applies to MySQL and other relational database products with a simple change to the engine configuration (see db_string).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three approaches for using SQLAlchemy\n",
    "Many developers who are already familiar with Python and SQL will simply install a thin Python wrapper to the database driver and write all the database logic using Python strings to execute raw SQL against the database.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outlines the three layers of abstraction at which SQLAlchemy can be used. The first approach presents the simple Python wrapper approach, just mentioned.  The next two approaches present increasing levels of abstraction, with the third approach interacting with our database in a Pythonic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note about ORM\n",
    "In the discussion that follows ORM stands for Object-relational mapping, which is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. Many popular SQL database products can only store and manipulate scalar values such as integers and strings organized within tables. The programmer must then convert the object values into groups of simpler values for storage in the database (and convert them back upon retrieval).  ORM facilitates this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benfits of SQLAlchemy\n",
    "SQLAlchemy offers several benefits over the raw SQL approach, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cleaner code:** Embedding raw SQL code in Python strings gets messy pretty quickly,\n",
    "* **More secure code:** Using SQLAlchemy's ORM functionalities can help mitigate against vulnerabilities such as SQL injection,\n",
    "* **Simpler logic:** SQLAlchemy allows us to abstract all of our database logic into Python objects. Instead of having to think on a table, row, and column level, we can consider everything on a class, instance, and attribute level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caveat\n",
    "SQLAlchemy interacts with relational databases; it does not support NoSQL databases, such as Cassandra and Mongo.  Two poular software libraries that provide Python support for NoSQL are PyMongo (simple) and MongoEngine (ORM functionality).  See https://realpython.com/introduction-to-mongodb-and-python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "1. PostgreSQL database running at localhost port 5432\n",
    "2. A database named \"sqa_test\"\n",
    "3. The password for the database (db_key) is defined in config.py\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "1. Each snippet for the three approaches is meant to be executed individually (do not run all as one step). \n",
    "2. Each snippet creates a table in the database named \"films\".  Unfortunately, as written, the snippets for Approach # 1 and # 2 will throw an \"Duplicate Table\" error if that table already exists.  To remedy, use pgAdmin to delete the films table before executing those snippets.  This is not applicalble for Approach # 3."

    "In this section, each of the CRUD operations against PostgreSQL are run through SQLAlchemy, using only raw SQL statements. Using this method, we get none of the advantages mentioned above, and we may as well use only a basic Python database driver (e.g. psycopg, which is the most popular PostgreSQL adapter for the Python programming language and which we need to install along with SQLAlchemy in any case)."

Even with such a simple case, our database code is already getting messy.

We'll see that this code is a little bit more verbose, and also fairly complicated and difficult to read, so we don't gain that much over the raw SQL queries above. But we can see that we're already starting to get closer to interacting with our database in a pythonic way."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "So what is the catch in using a SQLAlchemy abstraction layer to implement object-oriented progamming techniques for interacting with a database?  Well, you might assume that there can be a hit to performance, which would be noticeable for very, very large databases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, databases seldom exist in a vacuum -- outboard programs must be used to do useful things with those databases (web pages, visualization, analysis).  Earlier techniques sent raw SQL commands to the database using a Python wrapper, which may be appropriate for throw-away code (non-maintained) or when existing SQL code must be used.  This approach \"may\" also affect performance less than when using an ORM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ORM is useful for keeping your code Pythonic and to abstract away from the database completely. It allows one to deal directly with Python classes instead of Tables, with instantiations of objects instead of rows, and with object attributes instead of columns. It also abstracts away from the specific database flavor of the day that you're using, as SQLAlchemy has drivers for popular database products."
